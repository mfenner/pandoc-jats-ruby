# pandoc-jats-ruby

This gem is obsolete, as of Pandoc 2.0 a JATS writer is [part of the core Pandoc package](https://pandoc.org/releases.html#pandoc-2.0-29-oct-2017).

A Ruby gem that packages the [pandoc-jats](https://github.com/mfenner/pandoc-jats) Lua [custom writer for Pandoc](http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/README.html#custom-writers) generating **JATS XML** - specifically [Journal Publishing Tag Library NISO JATS Version 1.0](http://jats.nlm.nih.gov/publishing/tag-library/1.0/index.html).

## Template
`pandoc-jats` uses the template `default.jats` - the template uses the same format as other [Pandoc templates](https://github.com/jgm/pandoc-templates) (e.g. if/end conditions, for/end loops, and a dot can be used to select a field of a variable that takes an object),
but is more complex because of the extensive metadata in JATS. Templates are parsed by Pandoc, not the custom Lua writer.
